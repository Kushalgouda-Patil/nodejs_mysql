 Imagine you are developing a web application that manages a car management system in showroom. 
 THe application has a database with two tables, Car and customer. 
 The car has columns like carid,model_name,year_manufacture,speed,price,custid. 
 The customer table has columns, custid,customer_name,address,age.
 
 Your task is to create a Nodekjs server that interacts with db using sql queries to perform the following operrations
 1Retriev the list of all cars in showroom
 2Retreive the list of all cars in those are manufactited in year 2019
 3 add new car
 4 delete a car whivch is very old model
 5 display latest 5 cars
 How would you structure sql queries in your nodejs application to achieve these operations efficiently?
 
INSERT INTO customer (custid,custname, addr, age)
VALUES 
  (1, "kushal", "dharwad",20);

INSERT INTO customer (custid,custname, addr, age)
VALUES
